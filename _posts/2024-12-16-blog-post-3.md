### It just take several simple steps to make your page powered by `Jekyll` & `AcademicPages` visible to search engine(taking Google as example)!
*Your persoanl homepage will not automatically be visible to search engine, which means others cannot find your page (but still can access your page through URL) through searching for your names or other relevant information. Hence, you need to take a few step to "register" your webpage to make it available to search engine*
1. Go to [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console).
2. Add your website (take this webpage as an example: https://tom-liii.github.io/) as a property.
3. Select the ***HTML file upload*** method.
4. Download the HTML verification file (e.g., google1234567890abcdef.html).
5. Place the HTML verification file to the root of your Jekyll project or Github repository.
6. Add the following to `include` section in `_config.yml` as following:
```markdown
include:
  ...
  - google1234567890abcdef.html
```
7. Now your can verify the ownership of your page. 
8. Wait for the search engine to process your data, which may take a day or so.
